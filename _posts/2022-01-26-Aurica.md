---
## Wield powerful and diverse magic in a strategic battle between mages. Every player is unique, with a pseudo-randomly generated Aura that interacts with every spell you cast and every hit you take. Aurica has a magic system with unparralled depth and intricacy. The ceiling for growth in Aurica is limited only by your dedication. ##


# Description #
Players face each other or against monsters in multiplayer battles of skilled spell casting. To excel players must learn the strengths of their own pseudo-randomly generated Aura. A player's Aura is a distribution of mana that will interact with spell casting to make spells stronger or weaker depending on how the spell is composed. The magic system is incredibly deep but retains an ease-of-use that lets casual players have as much fun as the more dedicated players.

There are a wealth of spell options to choose from in each battle, with over 70 unique spells from 10 different schools of magic, and more are being developed constantly.

### Novel features ###
The intent of the magic system is to create a novel system for spell-casting that has incredible depth but maintains a low barrier of entry for casual players. Some key features of the system include:

- **Unique player Auras:** every player has a completely unique Aura that influences how the magic system works for them.
- **Personality-based strengths:** take the quiz or randomly roll your Aura to shape the magic system to your preferences.
- **Classless spell-casting:** every player can cast any spell at any time.
- **Glyph drawing:** spell components can be drawn on the screen with glyphs to cast spells and rebind your loadout on the fly!
- **Spell crafting:** spells can be crafted using components to have enhanced effects at the cost of additional mana.
- **10 mana types:** many different mana types each with their own lore, unique spell-styles and type identities!
- **Cultivation:** participating in PvP matches or defeating tough enemies in adventure mode earns cultivation to develop your Aura.

## Gameplay and Design ##
### Core gameplay loops ###
The core gameplay loops for when players get into a room (shared multiplayer spaces) are similar to most match-based PvP or PvE games. The main difference comes from the downtime between the action where players have the choice to rebind their spell loadout to better suit the next fight. Environmental advantages or knowing the opponent's favoured spells can completely change your playstyle and what spells you want bound for the next match. New players can skip these difficult decisions by choosing a class loadout from pedestals that give a static set of spells. The classes range from playstyle-based (ex. a short-range aggro mage, area-control AoE mage, summoner style, etc...) to mana types (ex. all fire spells, all death spells, etc...). A feature in progress is an account-bound loadout that players can access outside of matches to rebind to at will so that they can experience other classes and expiriment with new spells without losing their favourite loadout.

Pictured below are two class loadouts, for the Infernomancer (fire mage) and Warlock (demonic mage) respectively.

#### Player versus Player (PvP) loop
1. Enter a PvP arena room using a room code or going to the default room
2. Experiment with magic and find the right spell loadout
    - Advanced: Go through spell crafting gameplay loop (see below)
3. Start the match
4. Cast spells for defense and spells to attack your opponent(s)
    - Advanced: Rebind spell loadout on the fly to counter opponents spells
5. Win/Lose
6. Repeat from step 2


#### Player versus Environment (PvE) loop
1. Enter adventure mode
2. Experiment with magic and find the right spell loadout
    - Advanced: Go through spell crafting gameplay loop (see below)
3. Explore the area in search for enemies or static loot
4. Find an enemy or group of enemies
    - Advanced: Rebind spell loadout to best deal with the enemies resistances and attacks
5. Defeat the enemy
6. Gather cultivation point loot crystals
7. If satisfied with your current spell loadout, repeat from step 3. Otherwise, repeat from step 2



### Auxiliary gameplay loops ###
#### Spell crafting loop ####
1. Choose a spell to begin crafting
2. Cast the key components for that spell
    - Advanced: if the key components have a flux or siphon distribution they can be cast later for full effect or first to have no effect
3. Observe the ideal mana distribution for the chosen spell, as well as the spell strength and mana cost of the current casting
4. Determine which mana types are far from the ideal levels
5. Find a spell component that will bring the mana in the current casting towards the ideal mana for the spell
6. Cast that component into the spell and observe the new spell strength percentage and increased mana cost
7. If the spell strength is not at an acceptable level (150% is the maximum strength) AND the mana cost of the crafted spell is within a reasonable amount, repeat from step 3
8. Bind the newly crafted spell to your current loadout by clicking one of the bound spell buttons along the bottom of the screen

### Motivations for unfairness ###


### Challenges ###
#### Finding the fun ####
#### Game Balance ####
#### Keep the skill floor low and the ceiling high ####
#### Netcode ####
