<h1 style="color:midnightblue">Description</h1>
<h4>Wield powerful and diverse magic in a strategic battle between mages. Every player is unique, with a pseudo-randomly generated Aura that interacts with every spell you cast and every hit you take. Aurica has a magic system with unparralled depth and intricacy. The ceiling for growth in Aurica is limited only by your dedication.</h4>

Players face each other or against monsters in multiplayer battles of skilled spell casting. To excel players must learn the strengths of their own pseudo-randomly generated Aura. A player's Aura is a distribution of mana that will interact with spell casting to make spells stronger or weaker depending on how the spell is composed. The magic system is incredibly deep but retains an ease-of-use that lets casual players have as much fun as the more dedicated players.

There are a wealth of spell options to choose from in each battle, with over 70 unique spells from 10 different schools of magic, and more are being developed constantly.

<h2 style="color:midnightblue">Novel features</h2>

The intent of the magic system is to create a novel system for spell-casting that has incredible depth but maintains a low barrier of entry for casual players. Some key features of the system include:

- **Unique player Auras:** every player has a completely unique Aura that influences how the magic system works for them.
- **Personality-based strengths:** take the quiz or randomly roll your Aura to shape the magic system to your preferences.
- **Classless spell-casting:** every player can cast any spell at any time.
- **Glyph drawing:** spell components can be drawn on the screen with glyphs to cast spells and rebind your loadout on the fly!
- **Spell crafting:** spells can be crafted using components to have enhanced effects at the cost of additional mana.
- **10 mana types:** many different mana types each with their own lore, unique spell-styles and type identities!
- **Cultivation:** participating in PvP matches or defeating tough enemies in adventure mode earns cultivation to develop your Aura.

### Core gameplay loops ###
The core gameplay loops for when players get into a room (shared multiplayer spaces) are similar to most match-based PvP or PvE games. The main difference comes from the downtime between the action where players have the choice to rebind their spell loadout to better suit the next fight. Environmental advantages or knowing the opponent's favoured spells can completely change your playstyle and what spells you want bound for the next match. New players can skip these difficult decisions by choosing a class loadout from pedestals that give a static set of spells. The classes range from playstyle-based (ex. a short-range aggro mage, area-control AoE mage, summoner style, etc...) to mana types (ex. all fire spells, all death spells, etc...). A feature in progress is an account-bound loadout that players can access outside of matches to rebind to at will so that they can experience other classes and expiriment with new spells without losing their favourite loadout.

Pictured below are two class loadouts, for the Infernomancer (fire mage) and Warlock (demonic mage) respectively.

<h4 style="color:darkred">Player versus Player (PvP) loop</h4>

1. Enter a PvP arena room using a room code or going to the default room
2. Experiment with magic and find the right spell loadout
    - Advanced: Go through spell crafting gameplay loop (see below)
3. Start the match
4. Cast spells for defense and spells to attack your opponent(s)
    - Advanced: Rebind spell loadout on the fly to counter opponents spells
5. Win/Lose
6. Repeat from step 2

<h4 style="color:darkgreen">Player versus Environment (PvE) loop</h4>

1. Enter adventure mode
2. Experiment with magic and find the right spell loadout
    - Advanced: Go through spell crafting gameplay loop (see below)
3. Explore the area in search for enemies or static loot
4. Find an enemy or group of enemies
    - Advanced: Rebind spell loadout to best deal with the enemies resistances and attacks
5. Defeat the enemy
6. Gather cultivation point loot crystals
7. If satisfied with your current spell loadout, repeat from step 3. Otherwise, repeat from step 2


<h4 style="color:darkblue">Spell crafting loop</h4>

1. Choose a spell to begin crafting
2. Cast the key components for that spell
    - Advanced: if the key components have a flux or siphon distribution they can be cast later for full effect or first to have no effect
3. Observe the ideal mana distribution for the chosen spell, as well as the spell strength and mana cost of the current casting
4. Determine which mana types are far from the ideal levels
5. Find a spell component that will bring the mana in the current casting towards the ideal mana for the spell
6. Cast that component into the spell and observe the new spell strength percentage and increased mana cost
7. If the spell strength is not at an acceptable level (150% is the maximum strength) AND the mana cost of the crafted spell is within a reasonable amount, repeat from step 3
8. Bind the newly crafted spell to your current loadout by clicking one of the bound spell buttons along the bottom of the screen

### Motivations for unfairness ###

#### Offering an individualized experience

Because of the unique Auras, *every* player is going to have a different experience with the magic system and will go through a different learning and growth process. I plan to implement as many mechanics as is reasonable to encourage this aspect of the magic system. 

The primary and almost singular gate to progression is knowledge. There are no limitations on which spells you can cast, either by classes or experience requirements. Theoretically you can go from a weak and naïve player to a dominating archmage with intimate knowledge of *exactly* what makes themselves so powerful, in just one day (which I think is a very compelling fantasy). But, there has to be a way to slow players down from reaching maximum power by just reading a few wiki articles. This individualized Aura is my attempt at solving this problem. Player’s cant copy spells from each other because the spells could have drastically different efficiencies if their Auras have even one misaligned or imbalanced mana type. To progress you must go experiment with spells and spell combos, then craft those spells into stronger versions by balancing the mana distributions. Later on, as the player cultivates their Aura into a desired shape, sharing spells and metagaming can arise, but the hope is that at that point the players will  have the knowledge to determine what the best cultivation options for them are and can counter dominant strategies with spell rebinding.

There is much more planned for creating an individualized experience. If it seems like what there is right now isn’t enough for this level of enthusiasm I implore you to just wait and see.

#### Thematic comparison with nature

Let’s start off this section with a nice and big hypothetical question, if magic were to exist in the real world as we know it, how would it work? In my imagined world, magic would behave very similarly to nature. The physical world as we know it has occurred entirely through random chance, but follows the same fundamental laws, physics. If magic were to exist on earth I would picture it to work similarly. Completely unbound by everything but the laws of magic itself.

The way living things experience the randomness of nature is largely unfair. Survival is for the fittest and the evolution game picks the winners. There is nothing fair about a fight between a hungry lion and a tired antelope with nowhere left to run. There is nothing fair about a race from a tsunami between a genetically gifted runner and someone born with cerebral palsy. Genetics and environment are massively unfair advantages that we use daily for survival. From this comes my idea for magic users to have unique Auras, like genetics it is a base of a random roll, and with influence from your personality and actions it will grow towards your ideals. At the beginning it might be very unfair, but if you train enough you can make a strong comeback from a hard start.

### Challenges ###
I will freely admit that this kind of gaming experience is not for everyone. The system isn’t designed for mass-market consumers who most of the time want quick, easy, and viscerally satisfying advancement. Instead, it is designed for the dedicated players who care enough to better their skills within the deep and rich magic system and learn the best ways to advance. The system is built for a more niche market of gamers who will really appreciate the depth. However, the game that this system resides in does not have to follow that exact same standard. Efforts can and will be made to make the game as fun as possible for casual players. Any player should be able to hop into the game and start blasting away with spells. The spells they throw may not be very high powered or at all suited to their Aura but with well-designed gameplay and game feel the experience can still provide that quick and high impact fun that casual gamers can enjoy.

#### Game Balance ####
Balance in an unfair system like this is incredibly difficult. I think some would say it is impossible, but my opinion is that as long as there is a competitively viable strategy for every player then the balance becomes more of a metagame. The Aura system really messes with balance but the wide variety of spells actually does a lot to counteract this. Not every spell requires high levels of Aura, there are plenty of spells that work better when your Aura levels are comparatively low. For every Aura combination there are going to be spells that you can cast at high efficacy that another Aura combination cannot. The secondary effects of spells also scale with spell strength so even if a relatively low-power-budgeted spell is cast at a very high efficacy it can have the same, or better, effects as a more powerful spell cast at low efficacy. So, keeping up a high number of competitevly viable spells for different Aura levels will help offset the imbalance. However, I highly doubt that this tactic will be very effective at managing **perceived** game balance. Inexperienced players will most likely look at a powerful player and complain about not being able to cast any of the same spells. I haven't found the right solution to this yet but my inital thoughts are to provide players with a guided tutorital showing them their strengths and how they can use them to get a leg up on the competition using their own unique spells.

#### Keeping the skill floor low and the ceiling high ####
The problem with the very in-depth spell mechanics for the game is that a lot of players will not care about interacting with it at all, they just want to blast things with spells. Therefore, I need to keep the skill floor of the game nice and low. At the same time, I want to provide dedicated players a way to really dive into the game and come up with emergent strategies and new techiniques for casting and spell crafting, because the hardcore players are the lifeblood of the game. Therefore the skill ceiling of the game should be as high as I can make it (because that's how I like it, not because it's how it needs to be).

##### Keeping the skill floor low
To start playing the game without crafting spells and a personalized spell loadout, I implemented class stones, which were mentioned previously. The class stones rebind your loadout to a static set of spells with a common theme or an intended playstyle. New players can pick and choose between the class stones at any time and just casting to see which one they like best. The spells bound to the class stones have high error tolerance (for the most part), so even if your Aura is not perfectly suited to casting them they will still have decent-to-good spell strength without needing to do any crafting. I plan to implement a part in the tutorial that will show you which class your Aura is best suited for and which will be your weakest. There is also generous auto-aim for most spells, especially the most basic and common spells, this is to put the focus more on the spells themselves than on developing aiming and predictions skills. The auto-aiming also opens up the options for spells to travel more slowly, giving players time to react if they want to counter the spell by shielding, dashing away, or shooting the spell out of the air (if applicable). Additionaly, players are givin two recharging instances of a dash effect that can be initiated by a dedicated keybind instead of needing to cast a spell and using up precious spell binding slots.

##### Setting the skill ceiling high

#### Finding the fun ####
Keeping casual players entertained is really important for a multiplayer game, and it's been the main problem that I have been dealing with since the very first protoypes of this game.
