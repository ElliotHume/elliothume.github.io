### Personal project for learning game system design
I am currently developing a multiplayer PC game using the Unity game engine. Aurica is a multiplayer action-strategy game where players face each other and monsters in magical battles with an incredibly deep magic system. I go into much more detail about the development process and how the game works in my portfolio post and the GitHub page linked below.

### Personal project for learning Unity VR game development
I created a VR game in Unity for the Oculus Quest VR headset. Labyrinthian is a single-player puzzle game where the player uses magic to progress through increasingly challenging puzzles. I go into more detail about the development process and how the game works on the GitHub page linked below.

### University capstone project and personal project
Runic Warfare is the game that I created in partnership with Ian Hume and Eric Du for our university capstone project. The game is a networked PvP magic dueling game. We originally created this game as a PC game, but in the summer of 2020 I personally expanded the game to include VR gameplay for the Oculus Quest.

I go into more detail in my [blog post about Runic Warfare](https://elliothume.github.io/RunicWarfare/) and I encourage you to check out the game trailer there, or on the GitHub page linked below.
